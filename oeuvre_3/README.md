# Watch You
## Installation
1. Clone the project to your machine.
2. I recommend using Visual Studio Code to open the project and installing the "Live Server" extension to launch the project.
3. Once installed, right-click on the "index.html" file and select "Open with Live Server".
4. You can change the program being executed by replacing the "arrow.js" file with "arrow2.js" or "arrow_album.js" in the "index.html" file.

## Artistic Approach Explanation
For me, art is about expressing something without words but with feelings. I wanted my piece of art to convey something important. I experimented with different ideas but settled on something impactful. I used this dataset ([Dataset](https://github.com/sharmaroshan/WHO-Suicide-Statistics)) to gather statistics on suicide. I was inspired by the movie Watchmen. I started by creating a smiley face and then decided to show a second smiley to illustrate the difference between men and women. It somewhat resembled Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol. Next, I cleaned the dataset to retain only the necessary data. I added a drop of blood for each year on the badge for men or women. The color changes for each age group, and the diameter changes based on the number of deaths. I finished by animating it to better understand the number of deaths.
